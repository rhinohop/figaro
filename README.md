scaffolder
=========

A POCO class and MVC controller generator for CRUD database entities. 

Why? I grow tired of writing identical boilerplate code over and over again.

This project aims to be a library that will then be linked to a console application and a Windows Forms application. For now the library will provide basic Simple.Data repository-esque methods for the POCO classes. In the future I might include other data access libraries (Dapper comes to mind).

To download the latest release, click [here.](http://get.effsoftware.org/dl/scaffolder.zip) No need to install, just unzip the file and run scaffolderApp.exe from the extracted folder.
